"""Standalone MCP server exposing prompt-shield's scan API as MCP tools.

Consumed by MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot Chat,
and n8n. Runs over stdio.

Entry points:
    python -m prompt_shield.mcp_server
    prompt-shield-mcp

Re-exports are LAZY: ``import prompt_shield.mcp_server`` succeeds even when
the optional ``[mcp]`` extra (which pulls in the ``mcp`` Python SDK) is
missing. The ``mcp`` import only fires when a caller reaches for
``build_server``, ``run_stdio`` or ``warm_up`` — at which point the
``prompt-shield-mcp`` entry point's guard has already had its chance to
print an install hint on stderr.
