# MCP registry submissions — paste-ready

Registries where the `prompt-shield` MCP server belongs. Each entry below is
formatted for the registry's expected shape and can be pasted into a PR or a
form. **None of these are auto-submitted** — submit them yourself, in your
own name, when you're ready.

Update the version number and any counts to match the shipped release before
submitting.

## 5. Smithery.ai — hosted MCP registry

**Site:** https://smithery.ai/
**How:** Sign in with GitHub, click "Add server", fill in the form. Smithery
scrapes your repo's `smithery.yaml` if present.

Suggested form values:

* **Server ID:** `mthamil107/prompt-shield`
* **Command:** `prompt-shield-mcp`
* **Description:**
  Prompt-injection firewall exposing scan_input, scan_output,
  scan_tool_result, and list_detectors tools. Backed by 34+ detectors and a
  federated signed threat-intel feed.
* **Category:** Security
* **License:** Apache 2.0

Optionally check in a `smithery.yaml` at the repo root:

```yaml
name: prompt-shield
description: Prompt-injection firewall for LLM applications
version: 0.8.0
runtime: python
command: prompt-shield-mcp
args: []
env:
  PROMPT_SHIELD_CONFIG:

```

## 6. MCP.so registry

**Site:** https://mcp.so/
**How:** Submit via the "Submit Server" form on the site.

Same values as Smithery.

## 7. PulseMCP registry

**Site:** https://www.pulsemcp.com/
**How:** They index public MCP servers automatically once you're in one of
the awesome-lists above. No direct submission needed.

---

## Suggested submission order

The goal is durable presence with minimum friction. Prioritise registries
that require no ongoing maintenance:

1. **`modelcontextprotocol/servers`** — official, most authoritative, highest
   discovery signal. Do this first.
2. **`punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`** — largest community list on GitHub.
3. **Smithery.ai and MCP.so** — hosted registries with search + install UIs.
   Higher upside because a Cursor user can install by clicking, not by
   editing JSON.
4. The remaining awesome-lists — small individual upside; do them once and
   forget.

## Timing note

Submit only after you have:

* Cut a `v0.8.0` release tag on GitHub with the MCP server changelog entry
  visible.
* Published `prompt-shield-ai==0.8.0` to PyPI so `pip install
  "prompt-shield-ai[mcp]"` picks up the console script.
* Manually tested `prompt-shield-mcp` end-to-end in Claude Desktop or Cursor
  so the demo transcript in `docs/mcp-server.md` is reproducible.

Submitting before those three steps produces broken listings that maintainers
close.

## After the PRs merge

Add merged registry URLs to `docs/mcp-server.md` under a "Where to find
prompt-shield" section — that's evergreen social proof for anyone reading
the docs later.
